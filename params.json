Beaker's plugin-based polyglot architecture enables you to seamlessly switch between languages in your documents and add support for your favorite languages that we've missed.\r\n\r\nBeaker is both a server that you can run in the cloud, an application that you can download and run, and\r\na [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/beakernotebook/beaker/) that you can run anywhere.\r\n\r\nThis page is for developers.  If you want to use or learn more about Beaker, see the [home page](http://beakernotebook.com).\r\n\r\n#Screenshots\r\n\r\n![screenshots](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/master/doc/screenshots.png)\r\n\r\n#Publication Server\r\nNotebooks can published and converted into web pages that anyone can access with an ordinary web browser, even on a mobile device.\r\nThis free service is integrated into the application, and can be applied with just one click to any cell, section, or a whole notebook.\r\nPlots and tables remain interactive in published version.  Learn more, and explore a variety of notebooks from the user community on the [publication server](http://pub.beakernotebook.com/).\r\n\r\n#Build, test, and run instructions\r\n\r\nSee the page for your platform for how to build from source:\r\n[Ubuntu](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/wiki/Ubuntu-build-and-run),\r\n[Mac](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/wiki/Mac-build-and-run),\r\n[Windows](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/wiki/Windows-build-and-run), and\r\n[Docker](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/blob/master/Dockerfile).  We use gradle to compile the project.\r\n\r\nSay `cd test; ./runner` to run the end-to-end tests with Protractor.\r\n\r\nSay `cd test; ./perftest` to run performance tests with Protractor. Performance tests are pretty demanding and will lock up the browser performing the tests. Any interaction with the browser while the tests are running will affect the tests and skew the results.\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](http://ec2-54-175-192-115.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080/buildStatus/icon?job=Beaker master)](http://ec2-54-175-192-115.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080/job/Beaker master)\r\n\r\nTo enable the debug menu, add the following to your `beaker.pref.json` file:\r\n\r\n    \"notebook-app-menu-plugins\": [\"./plugin/menu/debug.js\"]\r\n\r\n##Presentation and Demo on YouTube\r\n\r\n[![Greenwood and Draves speak at PyData](http://img.youtube.com/vi/wu65cYffMSg/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wu65cYffMSg)\r\n\r\n##Language support\r\n\r\nWe currently provide support for Python, R, Julia, Groovy, Ruby, Java, Scala, Kdb, Clojure, JavaScript, HTML, Markdown, and LaTeX.\r\n\r\nBeaker supports *autotranslation* of variables between languages.  For\r\nexample, you can read and process some data in Python, model it with\r\nR, and then turn that into an interactive visualization with\r\nJavascript.\r\n\r\n##Architecture\r\n\r\nBeaker is primarily composed of a Java server and a Javascript client.\r\nThere are plugins for each language, and interaction plugins as well.\r\nThe architecture and the organization of the source is code is covered\r\nin the [Architecture\r\nwiki](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/wiki/Architecture).\r\n\r\nPlugin specifications: [Evaluator\r\nplugins](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/wiki/Eval-plugin-spec),\r\n[Menu\r\nplugins](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/wiki/Menu-plugin-spec),\r\n[Output display\r\nplugins](https://github.com/twosigma/beaker-notebook/wiki/OutputDisplay-spec)\r\n\r\n##Open source\r\n\r\nBeaker's full source code and documentation is available under the\r\nApache 2.0 license.\r\n\r\n##Contributing\r\n\r\nWe welcome developers to extend and improve Beaker in ways that can\r\nbenefit everyone. In order for us to accept your code or pull request,\r\nwe need for you to fill out and email back to us a scan of a signed copy of the\r\n[Contributor License Agreement](http://beakernotebook.com/cla.zip).\r\n\r\nWe're also looking to expand our full-time, NYC-based engineering team\r\nwith a [full-stack web developer](https://careers.twosigma.com/careers/JobDetail/New-York-New-York-United-States-Beaker-Full-Stack-Web-Developer/361).\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n![](HTTP://www.drvegoogle.com)",
